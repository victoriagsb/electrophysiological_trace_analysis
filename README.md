# Electrophysiological trace analysis code

Code for analysis of electrophysiological traces, including analysis of a membrane test, a low-pass Fourier filter and alignment of the electrophysiological traces to peak and onset of the action potential. The averages of raw and aligned recordings are then analysed to extract the amplitude, onset, width, rise and decay parameters.
