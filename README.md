# Electrophysiological trace analysis code

Code for analysis of electrophysiological traces, including analysis of a membrane test, a low-pass Fourier filter and alignment of the electrophysiological traces to peak and onset* of the action potential. The averages of raw and aligned recordings are then analysed to extract the amplitude, onset, width, rise and decay parameters.

*Onset is identified using the maximum curvature (4th derivative) method - see https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1113/jphysiol.2007.129833
